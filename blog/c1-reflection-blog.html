    <h1>Catherine Edwards - C1 Reflection</h1>
    <h2>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h2>
    <p>My honest take on the EDA experience is it's based on what individuals and the group as a whole put in. It's inspiring and exciting to hear that the boot camp is an overall experimentation of how to build a safe learning environment as motivating as possible. It's an approach to education that is well overdue in the information age.</p>
    <h2>What are your impressions?</h2>
    <p>The origins of DevBootCamp really resonated with me. Like Jeremy, I feel like I've hit a ceiling in my career, and I'm in a hard corner of business analysis where I feel like I cannot truly express myself and take a creative approach to problem solving. I also struggled with trying to code by myself: when I was looking for study options, I was looking for somewhere that could teach me the human aspect of software development. I have carried a lot of self-doubt in the last few years of my career: I always felt I was not good enough or skilled enough in what I did for a living. I struggled with healthy introspection: without constructive feedback loops, I'd spiral into despairing spells of anxiety.</p>
    <p>Now I feel I have an opportunity to learn how to express myself in a constructive and positive way, to co-create solutions to human problems, and to create a safe environment where everyone can express their approach just as much as I want to express my own approach.</p>
    <p>I love the phrase <i>world-class beginner</i> - like the rest of Western society, I have been trained to show up with the, "I know everything and don't know nothing," persona, which actually conflicts with who I feel I truly am. I feel like I lie to myself everyday. This furthers my spirals into anxiety. Being in an environment where humility, empathy, and curiosity is welcomed and fostered is where I feel I can be true to myself.</p>
    <p>Overall, my impressions of the bootcamp are positive, exciting, and inspiring.</p>
    <h2>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h2>
    <p>I remember receiving great feedback last year that said, "You need to listen more than you speak." That's something I practised in my everyday job, and it has improved my interactions with people dramatically. I will be treating myself as a blank canvas: listen, absorb, and reflect what I am being taught in the first couple of weeks of bootcamp. I will engage and contribute where I feel it is of benefit to my fellow students moreso than myself.</p>
    <p>I will be committing most of my waking hours to this experience (with the exception of DevOpsDays NZ), as this bootcamp will be the first chapter in my software development story, and I want to put in all that I can (in a measured, healthy way!) so I can set my own story on a path to success.</p>
    <h2>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h2>
    <p>My expectations of EDA have broadened and deepened. I really benefited from Shereef's comparison between the bootcamp experience and the traditional Western education experience. My mindset has certainly been more clearly framed, and I am more confident in articulating my approach to the bootcamp. I was also able to reflect more deeply about why I am joining this bootcamp in the first place, and I feel like I can be kind to myself in sharing my story with an open heart.</p>
    <h2>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h2>
    <p>I am extremely excited to join this kind of learning enviornment. I am looking forward to feedback coming from my fellow cohort attendees. I am looking forward to the social experience and forming lifelong relationships with other students. I am nervous about how much time I will be committing to this bootcamp - because I am prone to burnout, I will keep the time I spend in prep and bootcamp in check. I am very happy with my decision to pursue this bootcamp, and I am so grateful to the team at Enspiral Dev Academy for building this experience in New Zealand.</p>
