                    <h2>Sprint 1 Cultural blog - time and habits</h2>
                    <h4>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h4>
                    <p>
                        I have yet to try any of the timebox or habit tecnniques from these blog posts. I'm actually
                        wishing I had read through this issue first from Waffle.io! I'll learn to read through all of
                        the cards before starting on them in my next sprint.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, I have successfully used <a href="https://www.habitica.com/">Habitica</a> for tracking
                        my tasks and improving my habits! I've also been using <a href="https://toggl.com/">Toggl</a>
                        to start building awareness of how much time I am spending and using on a task.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even better news: Habitica and Toggl integrate with each other! So I can use Habitica to build
                        tasks, habits and intrinsic rewards, and Toggl to timebox my effort on those tasks as well!
                    </p>
                    <h4>What did you find interesting?</h4>
                    I found a number of things interesting across these articles:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The physical impact on the brain that meditation has.</li>
                        <li>Building smaller habits and anchoring them to established habits increases the likelihood
                            of those new habits being successful.</li>
                        <li>Creating smaller habits in the first place are more likely to be achievable than larger
                            habits.</li>
                        <li>Having a growth mindset means you'll naturally improve without sabotaging your own path to
                            growth.</li>
                        <li>Being forgiving and kind to yourself for being human, despite the industrial revolution!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>What worked for you?</h4>
                    <p>
                        I found BJ Fogg's observation about tracking weight resonated with me incredibly well. When BJ
                        was weighing himself every day, he was subconsciouly keeping himself on track with a feedback
                        loop. When he stopped weighing himself, his weight shot up! Fun fact: I have experienced this
                        EXACT predicament! This is the power of habits and feedback loops!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lesson learned: get back to weighing myself, every day!
                    </p>
                    <h4>Which will you experiment further with?</h4>
                    <p>
                        I really like the idea behind the Pomodoro technique. I'm going to try doing that at work this
                        week.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also will try meditating as a daily habit. I downloaded the <a href="https://www.headspace.com/">Headspace</a>
                        app which I will use to coach me this week.
