    <h1>Catherine Edwards - C1 Time and Habits</h1>   
    <h2>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h2>
    <p>
        I have yet to try any of the timebox or habit tecnniques from these blog posts. I'm actually wishing I had read through this issue first from Waffle.io! I'll learn to read through all of the cards before starting on them in my next sprint.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, I have successfully used <a href="https://www.habitica.com/">Habitica</a> for tracking my tasks and improving my habits! I've also been using <a href="https://toggl.com/">Toggl</a> to start building awareness of how much time I am spending and using on a task.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even better news: Habitica and Toggl integrate with each other! So I can use Habitica to build tasks, habits and intrinsic rewards, and Toggl to timebox my effort on those tasks as well! 
    </p>
    <h2>What did you find interesting?</h2>
        I found a number of things interesting across these articles:
        <ul>
            <li>The physical impact on the brain that meditation has.</li>
            <li>Building smaller habits and anchoring them to established habits increases the likelihood of those new habits being successful.</li>
            <li>Creating smaller habits in the first place are more likely to be achievable than larger habits.</li>
            <li>Having a growth mindset means you'll naturally improve without sabotaging your own path to growth.</li>
            <li>Being forgiving and kind to yourself for being human, despite the industrial revolution!</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>What worked for you?</h2>
    <p>
        I found BJ Fogg's observation about tracking weight resonated with me incredibly well. When BJ was weighing himself every day, he was subconsciouly keeping himself on track with a feedback loop. When he stopped weighing himself, his weight shot up! Fun fact: I have experienced this EXACT predicament! This is the power of habits and feedback loops!
    </p>
    <p>
        Lesson learned: get back to weighing myself, every day!
    </p>
    <h2>Which will you experiment further with?</h2>
    <p> 
        I really like the idea behind the Pomodoro technique. I'm going to try doing that at work this week.
    </p>
  <p>
      I also will try meditating as a daily habit. I downloaded the <a href="https://www.headspace.com/">Headspace</a> app which I will use to coach me this week.
