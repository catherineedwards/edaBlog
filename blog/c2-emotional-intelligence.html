    <h2>Learnings from Chapter 1 of Search Inside Yourself</h2>
    <p>
        I started this book with an open mind, with my trust and belief firmly placed in the team at Enspiral Dev Academy in recommending this book. As honest as an open book, I am someone who has depression and anxiety. I am treated and medicated for it, material such as this can be inspiring, uplifting, yet terrifying to see all the faults that the mind can bear with all of its strengths.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first key learning I found was the structure of emotional intelligence in the following five domains, and how I reflected on them:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Self-awareness. I feel I know where I am, and where I am going, whether it be in the moment of conversation, or reflecting on my life overall. However, I do dwell and analyse myself to the point where it no longer presents value - rather, it can be harmful if not moderated. This is why I try to verbalise what I am thinking and feeling, to test my self-awareness against other feedback loops.</li>
        <li>Self-regulation. Oh boy, am I terrible at this. I will wax and wane between positive and negative states, act and negatively reject impulses, and either be over protective or irresponsible with my resources at hand. I can also lose myself in the moment when I am under stress or pressure: to the extent that I have to physically remove myself from a conversation, as I no longer trust myself with what I am about to say or do. I'm hoping to resolve this over time. I've come a long way with treatment and self-care, but I still have a long way to go.</li>
        <li>Motivation. My motivation is generally good, but I have had dark periods where I have struggled. The biggest killer of my motivation is when I cannot see my actions correlate to a result, whether that be immediate or long-term. If I have no sense of feedback - positive or negative - I fall into a rut of silence, and I close myself off from people. I try to break the rut by reaching out, so I keep my motivation levels in check that way.</li>
        <li>Empathy. I am very empathetic, and I will strive for building a positive, supportive and empowering environment both at work and at home. I will pick up on people's emotions quite quickly (sometimes even before they realise it), and I will build a safe space for them to share their emotions and feelings with me.</li>
        <li>Social skill. I am social person, and I do my best to get on with people. If I inadvertently hurt someone, I will not take it well, and I will do my very best to make amends. I personally disagree with Goleman's definition of social skills - the <i>adeptnes at inducing <b>desirable</b> responses in others</i>. <i>Desirable</i> is always nice and preferred, but it's too easy and simplistic. I prefer <i>authentic</i> responses: I should be able to build relationships with trust, safety and rapport as the foundations of those relationships. I want people to be true to me, and I want to be true to them in return. I have huge anxiety issues with lying and the truth - there's a whole back story behind that, so hit me up if you want to talk about it some time!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The next learning I found was the correlation between <i>star performance</i> and the following factors:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Strong achievement drive and high achievement standards</li>
        <li>Ability to influence</li>
        <li>Analytical ability</li>
        <li>Initiative in taking on challenges</li>
        <li>Self-confidence</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        To me, this list drew a lot of parallels with the <a href="https://www.apsc.gov.au/ils-guide-integrated-leadership-system-aps-1-6-employees">Australian Public Service's Integrated Leadership System</a>. I used this system extensively to build my career when I was in the public service in Australia. I now have a new appreciation for what this system was trying to do for its employees: it just felt so cold, abstracted and bureaucratic at the time. If it had been shared with me in the way Meng shared his insights, I may have had a better time with using this system!
    </p>
    <h2>Two Minutes of Mindfulness</h2>
    <p>
        I found the two minutes of mindfulness a little challenging at first. I had to stop my internal voice from constantly asking, "Are we mindful yet? Are we mindful yet? Are we mindful yet?" - much like the restless child in the back of the car of the road trip!
    </p>
    <p>
        With some more sessions, I've learned to acknowledge the voice, but let it go do its own thing somewhere far away, along with all of the other sounds that encroach on my mindfulness sessions. I acknowledge them, but let them all go do their own thing. There's nothing I can do about them, so why should I take them to heart and analyse them? I feel a sense of relief wash over my brain: finally, less mental baggage it has to carry for me!
