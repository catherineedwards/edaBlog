            <h4>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h4>
              <p>
                I have been a big fan of meditation before reading this book. I often use guided listening tracks to help me sleep and recharge during stressful periods of my life. <a href="https://www.rickcollingwood.com/">Dr. Rick Collingwood's</a> tracks to help me sleep and think positively about myself and my life have had a profound impact on me. So there were no surprises in this chapter for me; just the joy of knowing that meditation is great for all concerned.
              </p>
            <h4>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h4>
              <p>
                The insight that was new to me was the correlation between those who need to think and focus for long periods of time on complex tasks (say, software development and programming) and the benefits of meditation helping those individuals. By meditation, the brain gains efficiencies in neuropathways and retaining attention for extended periods: hence, meditation can only be a good thing for an aspiring developer such as myself!
              </p>
            <h4>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h4>
              <p>
              The structure for mindfulness meditation given in this chapter was very appealing. It will help combat that voice that continuously asks, "Are we mindful yet?" in the back of my head! I will give this structure a go, and endeavour to practice it consistently from now on.
              </p>
            <h4>Any other musings?</h4>
              <p>
                It's great that there is an appreciation for a holistic approach to self-improvement when attaining web development skills. I feel I can only use these skills as well as I am in my default state, and I love the idea of being just <i>happy</i> in that default state! Definitely worth working towards this goal.
