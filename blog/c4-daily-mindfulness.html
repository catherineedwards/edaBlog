            <h4>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h4>
            <p>
                I was quite explicit with not telling my husband that I was having a 'mindful conversation' with him. I gave him all of the time he needed to talk about his motorbike that he had bought recently. I asked him about how it was working for him, how it made him feel, and repeated back to him these thoughts to close the loop.
            </p>
            <p>
                Eventually, he did pick up that I was speaking a little more differently - "You seem rather forced right now," he said. I think he was surprised that I actually wanted to hear about how happy he was with his motorbike... And he grew suspicious! I talked him through what I had learned from this chapter of the book. Honestly, he shrugged it off saying, "OK, you do what you got to do." But deep down, I know he will be reflecting on it further :)
            </p>
                
            <h4>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h4>
            <p>
                Between the following three suggested techniques:
                <ul>
                    <li>Having a buddy</li>
                    <li>Doing less than you can, and</li>
                    <li>Taking one breath a day,</li>
                </ul>
                I feel I will be taking (at least) one breath a day. I find these mindful breaths are best done at the end of the day, as I'm going to sleep. I breathe mindfully and reflect to myself, "That's today done, tomorrow is a new day."     
            </p>

            <h4>Any other musings?</h4>
            <p>
                I confess that this was the hardest chapter to absorb, along with the Javascript Basics work! This was a very intense sprint. Hopefully I'm ready for the next one!
