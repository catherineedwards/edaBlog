                    <h4>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Mindfulness and self awareness are two emotional competencies that may present themselves as
                        the same thing, but are actually quite distinct with their own purposes. It's when they are
                        used together that they enable the most compelling and powerful emotional competency: self
                        assessment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mindfulness is the practice of looking through your mind, your body, and your emotions
                        objectively, observing, defining and accepting your psychological, physiological and emotional
                        states. If you were to consider your whole being as a system, you can consider your everyday
                        happenings and experiences as, "Inputs," or even, "Arguments". With mindfulness, you can
                        observe what happens to your system when it is presented with an argument. With that
                        observation as your baseline, you can train or program your own system to a new state of being.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Self awareness, for lack of better expression, is <i>same but different.</i> While mindfulness
                        analyses the whole of the being deeply and extensively, self awareness is the constant
                        monitoring in real-time, keeping yourself grounded and focused. It's hardening your being for
                        the unpredictability of everyday, constantly querying whether your responses or actions are
                        acceptable or appropriate. If mindfulness is about defining your functions (your responses to
                        arguments or inputs), self awareness is parsing those arguments into those well-trained
                        functions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hence, the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness is that they are distinct
                        emotional competencies that share the property of being trainable and practical. They are
                        applied deeply and broadly, and they work in tandem to fulfil <i>self assessment.</i> The core
                        relationship built when both are used together is that one can build a repository of functions,
                        analyse these functions' responses to arguments, and train these functions towards an improved
                        end state. Repeating this process is continuous improvement, and response to the dynamic
                        unpredictability of the world around us: by harnessing this relationship wisely, we are ready
                        for anything.

                    <h4>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What
                        was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Today I tried Body Scanning after reading the self awareness practices from this chapter. Lying
                        down, I brought my mind into a neutral state and made observations about my physiological
                        state. I found I had a bit of a headache, and found it was above my left eye. I felt well
                        accustomed and well-trained in body scanning in its neutral state: I have listened extensively
                        to mindfulness audio tracks to help me sleep deeply.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To observe the physiological effects of my body in a happy state, I recalled some of my
                        happiest memories: those spent with my mother as a small child. The difference was utterly
                        profound. I felt an elevated sense of awareness in my hands, on top of my hands and arms,
                        elevated awareness on the bottom of my feet, and my legs were ready to have a "spring" in my
                        step. I imagined myself by my mum's side, laughing and walking and exploring the world with
                        her. I felt safe, energised, and eager to see what was next. I felt my breath shorten and
                        sharpen, ready for me to bound ahead. It was warm, and I was happy. My mum left this world in
                        February 2016, but I certainly felt her presence during that mindful moment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The self awareness practice was exhilarating, but frightening at the same time. I didn't
                        realise just how much emotions affected the body until this experiment. From this, I have lot
                        to reflect upon over the next few weeks.
                    </p>
                    <h4>What did you take away from the "My emotions are not me" section?</h4>
                    <p>
                        I found this section grounding and empowering. It brought emotions which are in a fraught state
                        of ambiguity and subjectivity into a neutral, objective state. Growing up, my dad always gave
                        me the advice, "Separate your concerns." If you can distance who you are from your emotions,
                        you can analyse things laid out in front of you carefully and calmly, without interference of
                        emotions clouding your judgment. It's also a powerful mechanism to redirect people from
                        criticising you over your emotional state - i.e. depersonalising arguments into problem solving
                        collaboratively and efficiently. This helps me continue to be an optimistic person: assume
                        positive intent from all. We all want to solve the same problems for the best outcome together.
                        Let's do it with enthusiasm and optimism.
