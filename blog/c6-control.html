            <h4>When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</h4>
            <p>
                I am finding it immensely challenging to express the logic, flow and sequence of events from instruction to code. This was profound in this sprint in the Minesweeper game. I had to discern between arrays and objects, and objects within arrays (what!!) and reference functions within nested loops.
            </p>
            <p>
                I found myself getting frustrated that I couldn't follow what the code was doing or saying, despite me having written it. It's like writing a blog post in English, and then reading it again to find it's in a foreign language. Over and over my basic instinct was to delete everything I had written and start from scratch, thinking I would immediately crack the problem with a clean slate.
            </p>
            <p>
                Instead, I'm practicing commenting out the code blocks which are giving me grief, and focusing on making sure the basics are working as I want, and I understand what they are doing. To use the blog-writing analogy again, I'm translating what I've written into a manner and form which I understand upon reflection and experimentation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The disproportionate emotional responses have been stemming from my year 7 to year 12 school years. I struggled to translate instruction to mathematic equations for problem solving. Rather than pushing through, I would internally punish myself with anxiety and unhealthy self-berating - <i>if everyone else can get this, why can't I?!</i> 
            </p>
            <p>
                This unhealthy inner voice was self-destructive. Rather than focusing on the positives I acquired growing up, I based my self worth only on my shortcomings and my inability to excel at Mathematics. Through reading <i>Search Inside Yourself</i>, I'm becoming aware that I am risking falling into this very same trap of inability to believe in <i>myself</i> when I can't solve the problem or get working code.
            </p>
            <p>
                Is there a quick fix? Of course not. Learning to be a developer in any language is all about practice, exposure, persistence, and resilience. But the fact that I recognise and acknowledge these factors now with minimal anxiety makes me proud that I have come a long way from where I was in my schooling years. I believe in myself, and I believe in my abilities. I have a lot of positive things about me: I have the persistence and resilience to see this through, and all I have to look forward to now are practicing and exposing myself to this wonderful world of coding!
            </p>

            <h4>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</h4>
            <p>
                I found this exercise exceptionally confronting: more than I was expecting! I recalled a collection of confronting experiences and interactions with people in both professional and personal contexts. My physiological symptoms were the same, and I built a 'pattern library' of symptoms to observe when I entered that state of experiencing anger. Interestingly, thanks to the book, I learnt how to look at my reactions objectively, and to let go of the internal debating of who was right and who was wrong (spoiler: there's no such thing as right or wrong! Just differences of opinion!)
            </p>
            <p>
                I will confess, I have to practice this exercise a lot so I can control my emotions during programming. I have to learn to let go of my frustrations and my inner voice from holding me back. Much like learning to program, learning to let go of my strong emotions will take resilience, patience, and persistence, but it will all pay off in the long run.
