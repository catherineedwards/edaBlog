            <h4>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h4>
                <p>
                    Tony Hsieh offers the following definitions of <i>pleasure, passion and higher purpose</i>:
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Pleasure</b>: this type of happiness is about always chasing the next high. It is the rock-star type of happiness because it is very hard to maintain unless you are living the lifestyle of a rock star.</li>
                        <li><b>Passion</b>: also known as "flow," where peak performance meets peak engagement, and time flies by.</li>
                        <li><b>Higher purpose</b>: this is about being part of something bigger than yourself that has meaning to you.</li>
                    </ol>
                    With my first sceptical glance, I was worried that this would set up a cycle of disatisfaction and unfulfilment. What if all of your expectations are built on a hubris that star, model employees can get into a perfect cadence of pleasure, passion and higher purpose as offered by Tony? My glum and gloomy thought was, "All power to you if you can find a work place that can set all of this up for you in a nice package." I don't look like it, but I can be a cynical and negative person (which I must improve!)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course, I have an open mind, flexible to new ideas that challenge and break my assumptions :)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reading through the chapter, I realised that you have to make your own cadence for yourself. No one else is going to meet the needs of your pleasure, passion, and higher purpose if you don't do some introspection and define for yourself what gives you fulfilment and enjoyment. <i>And</i>, you have to be willing to stand by what these things are for you, and keep true to them. Build your vision for what makes you happy, and people will be drawn to your passion and will help you follow your dreams.
                </p>
            <h4>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose exercise:</h4>
            <h5>What are your core values?</h5>
                <p>
                    My core values are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Integrity - being honest, and having strong principles.</li>
                        <li>Courage - being able to speak up for what is right, no matter the personal or reputational cost.</li>
                        <li>Respect, loyalty, and fidelity - following through on my promises, being respectful and loyal to those around me, and knowing I have to work hard to earn and protect others' trust.</li>
                        <li>Persistence and resilience - we can get to our goal, we just have to keep at it, no matter how hard it feels right now.</li>
                        <li>Kindness and compassion - assume positive intent from all, and treat everyone with the kindness and care you would need yourself to thrive.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            <h5>What do you stand for?</h5>
                <p>
                    I stand for:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Equal opportunity, everyone having a fair go.</li>
                        <li>Open-minded kindness and empathy.</li>
                        <li>Building the right goal for the right reasons for the right people.</li>
                        <li>Being transparent and accountable.</li>
                        <li>Self-care and continuous improvement - you have to learn to put the oxygen mask for yourself first before those around you, so you can support them with confidence in an emergency.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            <h4>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h4>
                <p>
                    Chade-Meng Tan offered the following ideas on resilience:
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Inner calm</b>: once we can consistently access the inner calm in the mind, it becomes the foundation of all optimism and resilience.</li>
                        <li><b>Emotional resilience</b>: success and failure are emotional experiences. By working at this level, we can increase our capacity for them.</li>
                        <li><b>Cognitive resilience</b>: understanding how we explain our setbacks to ourselves and creating useful mental habits to help us develop optimism.</li>
                    </ol>
                My first reading of this was a little challenging to my current thought patterns. I personally feel no capacity to celebrate success for myself on an individual level. This feeling was confirmed when I tried the meditation exercise: I could easily conjure my physical and emotional responses to memories of failure, but when I tried to reflect on memories of success, I struggled to find anything that I could <i>own</i> as my own success. My thought patterns continuously shifted those successes to being other peoples, hand-in-hand with my imposter syndrome. And when I found memories of success, my thought patterns shut down those emotions of success, as if I didn't have any right to feel good about myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Uh, did I mention I've got issues when I started this blog?
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, on one hand, it feels good that I can articulate and explore my issues objectively, with a goal to incorporate Meng's insights and wisdom into my work on self-improvement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the other hand - yikes, it's hard doing this introspection, but so worthwhile. I'm thinking I'll have to read this book again when I've finished my EDA journey!
                </p>
            <h4>Any other musings?</h4>
                <p>
                    I might take a nap to shrug off this minor existential crisis, and then try some more coding exercises!
