                    <h4>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Yes, I tried employing the <i>Just Like Me</i> and <i>Three Assumptions</i> techniques to grow
                        trust and sincerity.
                    </p>
                    <h4>How did it go?</h4>
                    <p>
                        I felt it went well. I have always tried to be a kind, loving, caring, and compassionate
                        person. This has sometimes been at the cost of my own boundaries, and projecting my own hopes
                        and desires for the other person onto the other person (whether they like it or not!).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I felt these techniques and exercises helped me
                        <ul>
                            <li>continue being a kind, loving, and caring person</li>
                            <li>recognise and wish for the very best for the other person (without exerting what I felt
                                was best for them), and</li>
                            <li>build thresholds for how much care I could exert without taking a personal toll.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h4>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h4>
                    <p>
                        I listened to a friend's problems over the weekend. To help my friend feel heard, safe to share
                        their vulnerabilities with me, and comforted by my insights, I
                        <ul>
                            <li>listened to my friend with my undivided attention</li>
                            <li>repeated back to my friend what I felt they were thinking or feeling</li>
                            <li>kept the dialogue open to elaborations, justifications, and corrections, and</li>
                            <li>gave insights with a considered blend of practical and thoughtful advice - advice for
                                the mind, and advice for the heart.</li>
                        </ul>
                        While I will not speak for my friend, I felt that I had a richer, much more thoughtful
                        conversation, and felt more confident in sharing insights and perspectives that took more into
                        account and consideration.
                    </p>
                    <h4>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The first time I tried this exercise, I thought of my husband and everything I wanted for him.
                        He was easy to visualise, and it was easy to convey loving kindness for him. In fact it was...
                        too easy. It was actually pretty intense!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From the intensity of the first attempt of this meditation, I decided to put change to object
                        of my meditation from my husband to a former coworker. This coworker and I had a disagreement
                        at one point, which I sincerely regret.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I visualised my coworker, I was also able to explore our disagreement objectively, and
                        see why we had the disagreement from our perspectives. I was able to calmly analyse that
                        neither of us did anything wrong: we wanted the same outcome for our own reasons, but we could
                        not agree on our approaches. There was nothing personal or malicious about it; just the
                        conflict in our respective approaches.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once I found the loving kindness for my coworker, I reflected on how I could have done things
                        differently, with positivity and kindness, and helped them bring out their own positivity and
                        kindness as well. This is a valuable lesson I have learnt for when I work together with my
                        cohort at EDA.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Complete the political awareness exercise</h4>
                    <p>
                        <i>Difficult situation:</i> When I was 18 and working in retail, a customer wanted to return
                        several
                        items back to our store for a refund. The customer called ahead and asked a coworker of mine if
                        they were entitled to the return. My coworker clarified with the customer that since the
                        transaction was originally a credit card transaction, as long as the same credit card was used
                        to complete the refund, the customer was entitled to a refund.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My coworker invited the customer to the store to carry out the return, and briefed me on the
                        conversation in case I had to serve the customer. Sure enough, I ended up serving the customer
                        while my coworker was out on a break.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>Situation as though I am 100% correct and reasonable:</i> The customer arrived with the
                        items to be returned, and I went through all of the items to ensure they were fit for return
                        (i.e in condition fit for sale). Once I cleared that, I went to process the transaction on the
                        credit card. This was when the twist happened...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Both the customer and my coworker had failed to validate that the customer was the cardholder
                        of the credit card. It turns out she was not the authorised/named cardholder: it was her
                        husband's credit card. Moreover, it was an Australian Defence Force-issued credit card, so I
                        knew we were in risky territory. While it was the same credit card that had been used for the
                        original transaction, and the items in question were eligible for a return, the customer in the
                        store could not authorise transactions for a credit card that was not in her name.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I explained this to the customer, and understandably, she was upset. Both my coworker and she
                        had failed to establish this fact prior to her making the effort to packing up the goods for
                        returning: as long as the original credit card was involved, it should all be smooth sailing.
                        However, the credit card's use for any transaction, purchase or return, could only be
                        authorised by the named cardholder. Otherwise, we're going into <i>fraud</i> territory.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To protect the store's credibility, reputation, and financial integrity, I had to deny the
                        processing of that transaction. I asked the customer if her husband could come in as the
                        authorised cardholder; however, her husband had just gone on deployment, and wouldn't be back
                        in the country for months. As a gesture of goodwill, I offered to extend the terms of the
                        return from 30 days to 6 months to accommodate this need. I also offered my line manager's
                        direct contact details to see if he could explore any other arrangements for the customer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I do not think there was an alternate outcome for the customer. It's quite possible she has all
                        of those items to this very day.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>Situation as though the other is 100% correct and reasonable:</i>

                        Understandably, the customer was very upset and very angry with me: I did not react or
                        counter her anger with me. I knew that I was not doing this out of malice: I was doing this
                        out of protecting all parties involved, including the customer. If there had been any
                        disputes involving the credit card and that transaction, all parties would have been liable
                        in some way.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Any other musings?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Eventually, the customer took all of the items she had wanted to return and left. She contacted
                        my manager and gave her account of the situation. Looking at it logically, pragmatically, and
                        considering my reasoning of the situation, my manager gave me his full backing with the
                        customer. He acknowledged that my coworker should have made the effort to clarify that she was
                        the authorised cardholder during the phone conversation, but all lines of credit with a lending
                        institute are subject to strict conditions such as these.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All in all from this experience, I learned that life is complex and not black-and-white. I cannot hold people to account when they vent their anger and frustration at me for upholding processes that are designed to protect them. Neither of us were in the complete right; I should have asked my coworker about whether he had clarified the cardholder situation before the lady came in.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even though I was 18, I was already working with kindness, integrity and goodwill. I will strive to continue doing so, but I also realise that I have a long way to go before I can be the very best version of myself.
