                    <h2>Sprint 9 Cultural Blog - Leadership</h2>
                    <h4>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</h4>
                    <p>
                        I have experienced a lot of compassionate leadership in tech, both in Australia and New
                        Zealand. In Australia, I worked on <a href="https://www.cloud.gov.au">the Australian
                            Government's platform-as-a-service cloud offering - cloud.gov.au</a>. In my immediate team,
                        I felt supported, inspired, and motivated to come in every day to change Australian government
                        for the better. My peers introduced me to the world of modern software development, service
                        design and product management with enthusiasm and kindness. I learned a lot about better ways
                        of working with people through my experience with the team.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In New Zealand, I have followed the <a href="https://www.digital.govt.nz/blog">Service
                            Innovation Lab</a>. This is an initiative to connect services across multiple agencies in
                        Government to deliver better outcomes for citizens, private and public sectors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What I have learnt most of all about compassionate leadership is that it's not solely reliant
                        on the management hierarchy (i.e. everyone above you) - quite the opposite. Good leadership
                        starts with you - the expectations you set of yourself, your peers, and your organisation. To
                        experience the very best from your organisation, you have to give your very best first. If you
                        find your organisation is not the very best that it can be, start working towards better, and
                        influencing those who can make it better on scale.

                    <h4>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</h4>
                    <p>
                        I found the multiplying goodness meditation fulfilling and invigorating. I felt a renewed sense
                        of confidence that I could make the world a better place in my own way, no matter how small.
                        All I can do with this self belief now is build upon it with further meditation and use it in
                        my everyday work/collaboartive efforts.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</h4>
                    <p>
                        As Meng predicted, Tonglen was a challenging meditation. I found it overwhelming to fix
                        everyone's problems all at once. I was also rather perplexed by how to draw in the problems as
                        gunk; I wanted to analyse and pore over every detail of the problems, which is what I do when
                        I'm talking with my friends. I guess I have to find a way to refactor people's problems simply
                        before I try to take them on - much like my own problems, and my code!
                    </p>
                    <h4>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The SCARF model is tricky to apply to my Phase 0 experience. I have been fairly isolated in my
                        preparation work. If we think about the words behind the SCARF model:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Status</b> - I like EDA's approach to having a flat-hierarchy model. No one is
                            superior or inferior. Everyone has equal learning opportunities, including the tutors. We
                            acknowledge that we all have different learning opportunities from one another.
                            <li><b>Certainty</b> - My certainty lies in my own commitment to the EDA course, completing my Phase 0, and making sure I am as prepared as possible for Day 1 of the course.</li>
                            <li><b>Autonomy</b> - I have had plenty of autonomy with doing my Phase 0 work, but with autonomy comes discipline and responsibility. I have had to make sure I have been keeping up with all of the tasks and work, and making sure what I am learning actually sticks in my head.</li>
                            <li><b>Relatedness</b> - Everyone I have found during EDA check-ins have the same things in common: we want to better ourselves, better the world around us, and learn in a supportive, non-judging environment. With these expectations and values, we can foster the best environment for mutual learning, and supporting each through all of experiences with EDA.</li>
                            <li><b>Fairness</b> - I feel from Phase 0 that we are all working fairly and respectfully. We are giving each other equal learning and teaching opportunity in the course.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h4>How will the SCARF model apply to bootcamp</h4>
                    <p>
                        I feel the SCARF model as I have described above will continue to apply in the same way in bootcamp, and it can only get better. Of course I will keep my contribution to the SCARF model in check, as the same people who benefit from a working SCARF model are the ones who build it. I will update with another blog how I am experiencing EDA in the context of the SCARF model.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go?</h4>
                    <p>
                        I'm actually finding myself having less difficult conversations since I started reading this book: that's to say more of my conversations are harmonious, calm, and orderly, with both parties understanding their part of the conversation. If I experience a difficult conversation during bootcamp, I'll update my blog with it and my experience with it.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Any other musings?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Bootcamp starts tomorrow, and I couldn't be more excited :)`
