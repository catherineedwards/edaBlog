    <h2>What is grid-based design?</h2>
    <p>
        Grid-based design is the approach to front-end development that considers webpages as a series of columns and rows. It's a continuation of how print media organises its content and images to be visually appealing and accessible for the everyday reader. Generally speaking, content is structured as headings, blocks of text, and images. By treating these content elements as boxes, they can be organised onto webpages depending on the style and the approach of the content designer, and the execution of the design by the developer.
    </p> 
    <h2>What's all the hype about responsive webpages?</h2>
    <p>
        As content has innovatively moved from the paper-based world to the digital world, digital device formats and resolutions have evolved over time. These days, we consume digital media using cell phones, tablets, desktop computers, and even more obscure devices such as wearables and video game consoles. To accommodate these different kinds of devices, webpage developers should make their webpages as responsive as possible, so the user can have the experience they expect consistently no matter their device.
    </p>
    <p>
        A website that is responsive is one that:
        <ul>
            <li>recognises the user's browser</li>
            <li>recognises the device's resolution settings, and</li>
            <li>rearranges its content to accommodate the needs of the user's device.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        An example of a good responsive website is <a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au">Kotaku</a>. As the pixel width is reduced, the webpage responds to this by condensing the header menu into a menu button, and resizing the image assets.
    </p>
    <p>
        An example of a website that does not provide a responsive experience is this <a href="https://www.genghiskhanrestaurant.co.nz/">Mongolion BBQ restaurant website</a>. While the food looks good, I am sure the website experience can be improved.
    </p>
    <h2>What is semantic structure?</h2>
    <p>
        Semantic structure is effectively marking the content with tags and machine-readable language to help browsers understand what the content is and what to do with it. Consider the meaning of HTML: <b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage. The tools that we develop can do whatever we want with the content we give them, but to ensure a consistent and accessible user experience, we must organise the content by giving it semantic structure.
    </p>
    <p>
        My favourite example of lightweight semantic structure is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">markdown</a>. While we are developing these webpages with HTML and CSS, markdown is semantic tagging that allows a variety of tools to interpret and render the content in ways that visually reflect the original semantic intent of the content author.
    </p>
    <h2>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.</h2>
    <p>
        I'm not much of a blog-writing person: in fact, I am that person who has this chronic habit of saying, "Oh, I should blog about that some time," and yet I never do.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm really enjoying these blogging exercises; not only am I reinforcing what I am learning from the coursework that I am doing, but I am also finding new ways to explain concepts I <i>thought</i> I knew before in ways that are actually meaningful and logical. I feel more confident in talking about things from a technical point-of-view.
