          <h4>What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important</h4>
          A responsive site is a web page or web site that has been programmed to:
          <ul>
            <li>Query the device and/or resolution capacity of the user's browser</li>
            <li>Review the assets and content it is presenting to the user, and</li>
            <li>Render the assets and content it is preesnting to the user based on the styling and the resolution
              capacity of the user's browser.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Another way to put it is that the website makes sure the the user experiences the website's content,
            design, and overall experience regardless of the device size they are using to read the site. Images too
            big for the screen? Resize them! Heading taking too much real estate on the screen? Resize that too!
          </p>
          <p>
            Responsiveness is important, as we want the user to experience our website and its content no matter the
            device they are using to reach our website. Rather than maintaining several source code repositories that
            are bespoke on a per-screen-type-basis, a well-built responsive website is one that is coded to render to
            any screen resolution from the one source code repository.
          </p>
          <h4>What mobile-first design is, and why it's important.</h4>
          <p>
            A mobile-first design is a website that has its default rendering behaviour as that on the smallest screen
            from the device range: mobile phones. Good design and software delivery assumes that the user has limited
            screen size, and then scales up to larger screens.
          </p>
          Mobile-first design is important for a number of reason:
          <ul>
            <li>If we as web developers assume that the user has the largest screen available, we end up making our
              design decisions based on a limited subset of users.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.stonetemple.com/mobile-vs-desktop-usage-study/">We have reached the point in
                technology where mobile users now exceed desktop users</a>.</li>
            <li>This is an incredible statistic: the demand for responsive designs will only increase from here, and
              should be considered best practice.</li>
            <li>We want our websites to work for everyone.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>What frameworks are, and their pros and cons.</h4>
          <p>
            Frameworks are code bases which have been built by other developers. They are built to demonstrate
            best-practice to other developers through the principle of, <i>Show, don't tell.</i>
          </p>
          The pros of frameworks are:
          <ul>
            <li>In the case of open-source frameworks, they are free to use, and you even have the opportunity to
              contribute to the project.</li>
            <li>A well-built framework doesn't bring function-breaking issues or questionable design decisions.</li>
            <li>They help the developer deliver at speed with solid foundations: the developer does not have to build
              their HTML or CSS from scratch.</li>
          </ul>
          The cons of frameworks are:
          <ul>
            <li>They take a while to get familiar with them for the first time.</li>
            <li>Learning how the framework works depends on a lot of trial and error and exploration.</li>
            <li>If the framework or any of its dependencies are redundant or no longer supported, it can be a nuisance
              to migrate to another framework.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>What a wireframe is, and why we use it.</h4>
          <p>
            Wireframes are content-agnostic ways of designing the structure of your website. IT enables web developers
            and designers alike to collaborate, assess feasibility, and agree on the execution of the structure of a
            website without writing a single line of code. This lets everyone involved in the website know what to
            expect in general from the structure of the site: no assumptions, no surprises.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wireframes also help developers organise their code around their website structure, and predict how many
            columns and rows are going to be needed for their grid-based design.
          </p>
          <p>
            I used these wireframes to design my website:
          </p>
          <img src="../images/wireframe-blog-page-desktop.jpg" alt="Wireframe of blog desktop page" class="responsive">
          <img src="../images/wireframe-blog-page-mobile.jpg" alt="Wireframe of blog mobile page" class="responsivetall">
          <img src="../images/wireframe-index-page-desktop.jpg" alt="Wireframe of index desktop page" class="responsive">
          <img src="../images/wireframe-index-page-mobile.jpg" alt="Wireframe of index mobile page" class="responsivetall">
          <h4>The aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to implement, and why.</h4>
          <p>
            I struggled to understand the grid design system until I went through the exercise of wireframing and using
            the Skeleton CSS.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, there are bits and pieces I've yet to implement properly, including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Appropriate padding in my Heading row.</li>
            <li>Images on my index page.</li>
            <li>The order of the content not being right on the mobile page (i.e. the heading should be above the
              icon).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I have parked these things as things to implement and fix in the future: perhaps with a wee bit of help
            from my friends!
          </p>
          <p>
            I am even going to keep a list of design goals in my OneNote:
          </p>
