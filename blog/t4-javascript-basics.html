            <h2>Technical Blog - JavaScript basics</h2>
            <h4>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h4>    
                <p>
                  Ahahahahahahahahahahaha *breathe* hahahahahaaaaa *wheeeeeze* ahhhhhhahahahahahaha my brain is so sore and broken I'm officially cackling mad from those exercises...!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Indeed JavaScript (JS) is a whole new level of wizardry and Dark Arts compared to anything else I have encountered in my career, and massive kudos to those who can at least dabble in this witchcraft and still make it out in one piece! :)  
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was challenging, but when I got stuck, I did some research to find out where I was going wrong. When I resolved what I was doing wrong - having that 'aha!' moment - that's where the magic was for me! I have taken a list of particularly puzzling exercises to walk through again with an experienced developer.
                </p>
            <h4>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'</h4>    
                <p>
                  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Control_flow">Mozilla Web Docs</a> defines <i>control flow</i> as, "the order in which the computer executes statements in a script." Simply put, the computer will do what the code tells it to do in the exact order in which the code is laid out.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Loop">The same Web Docs</a> describes <i>loops</i> as, "a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is met."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Using these definitions, we can apply the principles to the everyday analogy at a micro and macro level.  
                </p>
                <p>
                  Micro: Every morning, my body checks that I have had enough sleep. If I have had enough sleep, I will wake up. If not, I will continue to sleep. If I woke up, I will go brush my teeth. I will brush my teeth until I feel like they are clean.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Macro: Every day, I will check my retirement fund. If I have met my goal (of having enough money to use for the rest of my life without working), I will not go to work. If I haven't met my goal with my retirement fund, I will go to work.  
                </p>
                <p>
                  In both cases, what I am doing is performing a set of functions in a precise order. Within those functions, I will push through arguments (values that represent current conditions) against the statements, and I will keep looping in those functions until they are resolved.  
                </p>
            <h4>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h4>    
                <p>
                    An array holds different pieces of information, and assigns them values indexing from 0. Think of it like an ordered list:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Colours:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Red</li>
                    <li>Blue</li>
                    <li>Yellow</li>    
                </ol>
                <p>
                    If I said, "Please choose #2 of the Colours list," the response I will expect is, "Yellow." With indexing from 0, Red is 0, Blue is 1, and Yellow is 2.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the other hand, an object can hold values in an unlisted way. Using the Colours list above:
                </p>
                <ul>
                     <li>Red</li>
                     <li>Blue</li>
                     <li>Yellow</li>    
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Here, I would have to ask for the word, "Yellow" if I wanted to use the value, "Yellow". 
                </p>
                <p>
                    These are all rather simplistic terms, and I acknowledge I have a long way to go before being able to explain why a developer would use one over the other and for what use cases.
                </p>
            <h4>Explain what functions are, and why they are useful</h4>    
                <p>
                    These two words are going to be every developer's best friend: reusable code. Functions are code chunks that have performed a specific task and can be repurposed or re-used in either other codebases or contexts. They can even handle different use cases depending on the arguments that are pushed through them. Functions are likened to <i>procedures</i> or <i>subroutines</i> in other languages. They are a repeatable, repurposable task that can be called by other scripts or even other functions.
