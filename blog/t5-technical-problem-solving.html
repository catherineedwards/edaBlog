            <h3>Blocked on a Simple Problem</h3>
            <h4>What was the problem?</h4>
                <p>
                  <a href="eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html">The Chessboard exercise of EloquentJavascript.net</a> blocked me to the point that I completely lost faith in my abilities!
                </p>
            <h4>What problem solving techniques did you use?</h4>
                I went through the following problem solving techniques:
                <ul>
                  <li>Experimenting within loops</li>
                  <li>Looking at my results through Console.logging</li>
                  <li>Googling similar nested loop examples, and</li>
                  <li>Asking my peers and coaches for help.</li>
                </ul>
            <h4>How did you feel throughout the process?</h4>
                <p>
                  I honestly felt frustrated, dismayed, and totally confused by what was being asked of me, and how to progress. I had not been struggling with my exercises until this point. I was determined to push through, but knew I couldn't do it by myself.
                </p>
            <h4>What did you learn?</h4>
                <p>
                  I sought a different approach from my husband, who is an experienced software developer. I walked through the approaches and attempts I had made with this exercise, and he quietly and patiently observed and repeated back what I had done for his own understanding. While being a software developer, I also learnt that he is an excellent teacher. He did not give me the answer straight away: he encouraged me to try different approaches, and helped explain to me what the loops were doing in the code.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I learnt that ultimately I had to understand what my code was currently doing, what the desired end state is, and how I can revise the code to meet that need in the end state.
                </p>
                <h3>Blocked on a Simple Problem</h3>
                <h4>What was the problem?</h4>
                <p>
                  <a href="eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html">I was blocked on the Looping a Triangle exercise</a> of chapter 2 of EloquentJavaScript.
                </p>
            <h4>What problem solving techniques did you use?</h4>
                <p>
                  I tried several several ways to express the target end state using pseudocode. When I didn't achieve my desired end state, I referred to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN web docs</a> to clarify my syntax. I repeated this process 8 or 10 times.
                </p>
            <h4>How did you feel throughout the process?</h4>
                <p>
                  During this process, I felt relatively in control. I knew it was a matter of experimenting with syntax and learning from the results using console.logging. 
                </p>
            <h4>What did you learn?</h4>
                <p>
                  I learnt I had to be uncomfortable with the unknown, and to target my clarification from the docs (i.e. don't get too distracted by what else is available on the docs site!). I learnt that it was more than okay to check and recheck the docs: that's why they are there!
