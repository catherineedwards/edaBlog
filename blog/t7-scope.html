                    <h2>Sprint 8 Technical Blog - Scope</h2>
                    <h4>What is <i>scope</i>, and how does it work in Javascript?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Scope is a funny word in the world of tech. It can refer to the scope of the project we're
                        working on (and its evil twin: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep">scope creep</a>).
                        In video gaming, <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/360-no-scope">360 No Scope</a> is a
                        trick shot that has descended into dank meme status. But we're here to talk programming, and
                        specifically Javascript: so what is scope in Javascript?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Scope in Javascript defines the boundary or threshold in which a declared object or variable is
                        going to be used within the code. We can define an object or variable's scope by two parameter:
                        <i>global</i> or <i>local</i>. It's important to note that we don't explicitly declare the
                        scope of objects or variables in the code: we implicitly define their scope by where they are
                        placed in the context of code. They are can be localised to a function, or global to the whole
                        of the code.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Why define scope?</h5>
                    <p>
                        Good, clean code comprises lots of smaller functions that are strongly opinionated and loosely
                        coupled. This means that the individual functions have their tasks are very well specified
                        without having to rely on referring to other functions and their workings. This lets
                        programmers take out functions, refactor or rework them, and put them back into the rest of the
                        code with as little risk of breaking the overall functionality as possible (minimising risk,
                        interruption of delivery of value, and enabling continuous improvement with speed and safety).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With scope, we want our objects and variables to be used by our functions with as much safety
                        as possible, so we can isolate them for exclusive use by the function in question. We also want
                        to optimise the performance of our code, so we want to discard these objects and variables once
                        they have served their purpose. Once the function has finished performing its task, it throws
                        away whatever it doesn't need anymore, freeing our processing power for all the other tasks we
                        need to do.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While it doesn't feel like this would make an impact with the kind of code we're working on for
                        bootcamp, performance optimisation is a big school of thought in the tech world (and an even
                        bigger impact for clients and the products they are expected to run on their infrastructure).
                        We want to build the best habits possible from the very beginning, so we need to take and
                        understand scope very seriously in Javascript.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Global-isation</h5>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes, we have objects and variables that are strongly opinionated by design for the
                        overall code we are delivering. Outside of any functions, and typically at the very beginning
                        of the code, we define all of objects and variables for use.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Global variables and objects can be inherited by functions preceding those variables or
                        objects. We can ask a function to retrieve the value of a global variable or object. We can
                        even ask the function to change the value of that variable or object for the purpose of that
                        function.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, best practice is to avoid using global variables, and when we do, use them with
                        caution and care. This is particularly important in coding projects involving multiple
                        developers: one global variable that's been defined in different ways by different people can
                        arise in conflicts, both in code and in teams!
                    </p>
                    <h5>Shoot down to the local</h5>
                    <p>
                        OK, I've convinced you that localising your variables is better than globalising them. So how
                        do we do that?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Simply put, any variable or object that you declare <i>within</i> a function is exclusive to
                        that <i>specific</i> function. Here's an example:
                        <pre><code>function updateCounts () {
                            var totals = {
                              blue: 0,
                              green: 0,
                              invisible: 0
                            }
                        </code></pre>
                        In this example, the object <code>totals</code> is for the exclusive use of the function <code>updateCounts</code>. <code>totals</code> and its parameters cannot be used by any other function in the code (in this context, this is from the game we were asked to build in an earlier sprint).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After this function has been executed, <code>totals</code> and its parameters are discarded - not to be used or seen again anywhere else in the code!
                    </p>
                </div>
